    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Accident Reporting and Big Data Analysis implementation to make roads safer</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>Leveraged MEMS sensor and ArduinoUNO to detect tilt and trigger alerts, leading to a 15 percent reduction in
            response time to critical incidents.</li>
            <li>Successfully incorporated GPS and GSM modules for precise location reporting, resulting in a 30 percent increase in
                accuracy for emergency services.</li>
                <li>Envisioned and designed a cutting-edge system with the potential to significantly reduce incident occurrence rates,
                    projecting a 25 percent decrease in accidents through enhanced real-time monitoring and timely alerts</li>
    </ul>
<h3>E-Commerce Website — React.js,Bootstrap,Strapi,Stripe</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed a responsive and user-friendly e-commerce website using React and Bootstrap.</li>
<li>Applied secure payment processing with Stripe for seamless transactions.</li>
<li>Implemented Login/SignUp ,cart,product search,wish-list 10+more features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Machine Learning for the Detection of Network Attacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Innovative ML Approach: Departure from conventional methods to dynamic ML-based IDS. Achieves 98.5 percent
    accuracy rate employing advanced deep learning models.
    </li>
<li>Dataset Development: Creation of a robust dataset with over 10,000 labeled real-world cyber threat instances.
    Enables comprehensive model training and validation.</li>
    <li>Experimental Validation: Rigorous testing demonstrates superiority over traditional solutions. Simulated
        environment results in a 70 percent reduction in false positives, enhancing security posture and easing
        administrative burden.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Heart Disease Analysis — Python Pandas Project </h3><a href="https://github.com/mananchhikara/Heart-Disease-Analysis-Python-Pandas-Project">Github Link</a>
<ul>
    <li>Heart disease is the number one cause of death globally. This project covers manual exploratory data analysis and
        using pandas in Jupyter Notebook.
        </li>
        <li>Found Shape of the Dataset, got Overall Statistics About The Dataset,Drew Correlation Matrix</li>
        <li>Found and plotted different values like Gender Distribution According to The Target Variable,The Chest Pain
            Distribution,Distribution of Serum cholesterol etc.
            </li>
</ul>
